# Motion Playground

**Motion Playground** is a demonstration project built to showcase modern animation techniques and interface architecture in frontend development.

The goal is to highlight strong proficiency in **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Framer Motion**, with clean component design, theme management, and structured styling using **SCSS** and **CSS variables**.

---

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** – component-based UI architecture
- **Vite** – fast build and development environment
- **TypeScript** – static typing and maintainable code
- **Framer Motion** – animation and scroll interaction library
- **SCSS / CSS Variables** – structured styling and theming
- **Light / Dark Theme** – adaptive design using CSS variables

---

## Features

- **Multi-layer parallax background** with motion depth
- **Animated color blobs** reacting to scroll position
- **Scene transitions** based on scroll progress interpolation
- **Theme system** powered by CSS variables (light / dark)
- **Hero section** with left-side motion reveal animation
- **Clean modular architecture** with isolated logic and styles

---

## Purpose

This project is not a portfolio or landing page.  
It is a **technical showcase** demonstrating animation, structure, and motion design capability.  
The focus is on code quality, composition, and fluid interaction design — not on content or branding.
